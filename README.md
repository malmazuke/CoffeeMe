# CoffeeMe
An app for finding people to have coffee with!

## Getting Started
Just run `pod install`, and everything should be taken care of for you!

## API
*NOTE: I am not an API developer - please don't judge me too harshly for any questionable API design decisions*

An [Apiary](https://apiary.io) mock API is currently being used to mock User creation, etc. The documentation can be viewed here: [http://docs.coffeeme.apiary.io/](http://docs.coffeeme.apiary.io/)
